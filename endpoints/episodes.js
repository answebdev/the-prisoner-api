        trivia:
            "During the first American broadcast of the series, 'Living in Harmony' was not included. CBS stated that this was because of the episode's reference to hallucinogenic drug use, yet several authors disputed this argument, since mind-altering drugs were also present in other episodes (most notably A. B. and C. (1967)), yet these were not censored. Instead, they argue that the network feared Number Six' refusal to carry arms could be interpreted as an anti-war statement. As the plot was recognizably American, being a Western, they argue, the network banned the episode in fear that it carried with it a message against US presence in Southeast Asia, (the Vietnam War being at its height). Official spokesmen from CBS as well as ITC have since confirmed that the episode's implied war commentary was why it wasn't shown during its original US run.",
